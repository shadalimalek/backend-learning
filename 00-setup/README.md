# 00-setup

This folder contains setup and testing for my backend development environment.

## ✅ Tools Installed

- Node.js: v22.17.0
- npm: 10.9.2
- Git: Installed
- VS Code: Installed

## 🧪 Test File

```js
console.log("Backend ready!");

Run with:
  node test.js


---

✅ Once you’ve done that and you see `Backend ready!` in the terminal, we’ll start the next part:

### 📁 `01-javascript-basics/`

Let me know once ready — or say **“Start JS basics”** and I’ll guide you into your next folder: practice scripts, smart challenges, and revision-ready code.
